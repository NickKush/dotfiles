## TODO 

* Lazygit 
    - [ ] Setup `sh` script ot auto-link dotfiles in `~/.config/lazygit`


* Neovim
    - [x] Fix neovim installation script. Should download from github not from ppa:launchpad. It sucks..
    - [ ] If we don't have a plugin we got an error at start. maybe we can fix this?
    - [ ] Install/update for npm. pyright doesn't work without it...
